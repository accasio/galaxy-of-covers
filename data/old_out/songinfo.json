  "Comments": "The Leaves' first release of this song was recorded in the autumn of 1965. Around February 1966, the group asked their guitarist Bill Rinehart to leave and replaced him with Bob Arlin. In April 1966, a second recording was released (Mira 222, with \"Girl From the East\" on the B-side). This was quickly withdrawn, to be replaced by a third recording (confusingly also Mira 222, but with \"Funny Little World\" on the B-side). This third recording, featuring Bob Arlin on guitar, is the only recording of \"Hey Joe\" to make it to the Billboard Top 40. It is uncertain if Bob Arlin is also on the second recording.",
